## 0.35.0 (2025-04-25)

<csr-id-b2bccbc4d2ebb085a7958a0d077d65946369210d/>

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-a20b3d053b43d4613127e36994f181868cafb730/> Make email with spaces roundtrip.
   We see this situation in commits in the wild.

### Other

 - <csr-id-b2bccbc4d2ebb085a7958a0d077d65946369210d/> inform about untrimmed name and email

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-57366d3ebd622af8927bb0e199ab8a3c0eafee99/> turn `SignatureRef::time` field into `&str`.
   We also add a `gix_date::Time::to_str()` method, along with related utilities,
   to be able to turn a parsed time back into a raw buffer conveniently.
   
   Further, remove `Time::to_bstring()` in favor of a `Display` implementation.
 - <csr-id-545edf5c167d71586a049dc3a2ef2bede7e9d66c/> Make `SignatureRef::to_owned()` fallible.
   The contained `time` field is now a string, which has to be parsed into
   a time for conversion to an owned type.
   Additionally, replace `From<SignatureRef> for Signature` with `TryFrom`.
 - <csr-id-9825354f85e8e3d2ccdb23ff88c0976dbf094828/> Make Signature roundtrip
   By storing the raw bytes from Git instead of parsing them into a
   `gix_date::Time` from the start, we are able to roundtrip between Git
   and gix-actor even with creatively formatted Git data.
   
   Also add a test case that shows a time offset seen in the wild which
   would have failed to round-trip without this change.

## 0.33.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-17573779688e755a786546d5e42ab533088cd726/> remove all workspace dependencies
   The problem is that with them, we don't notice anymore if the crate changes,
   because a dependency changes. That also means that older versions of the dependency
   may stay even though some other crates might pick up a newer version.
   
   Ultimately, this will lead to drift and subtle incompatibilities.
   
   We declare this breaking to enforce a proper re-release.

## 0.32.0 (2024-08-22)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-031cd6884c925741112277529153870f69594c81/> major-version bump to accomodate for the type-change in `gix-date`.
   This should have happened automatically, but didn't, so the previous patch
   release broke the world (but was yanked).
   
   Now everything needs to be re-released.

## 0.31.1 (2024-03-18)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-741e3739ebd4bf48c3ef94b87ccce7602cb7cc2f/> allow parsing signatures with trailing numbers in offset
   That way this won't fail, but *just* silently degenerates information.
   
   The idea is that during FSCK, objects should be decoded and then
   re-encoded to see if they are still the same. If not, this means
   some leniency kicked in.
   
   Maybe for FSCK, there would also have to be a refactor so there
   is a lenient and strict parsing mode. One problem at a time.

## 0.31.0 (2024-03-14)

<csr-id-35592c9aa9665e1d9f554b589614fe59308a5f25/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-35592c9aa9665e1d9f554b589614fe59308a5f25/> update to `winnow` 0.6
   This upgrade is breaking enough and slipped through the radar the last time,
   leading to a now-yanked release that breaks `gix` v0.58.

  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.26.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.25.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/> switch `nom` to `winnow` in remaining uses in `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, and `gix-actor` for ~20% more performance.
  It's likely that over time, these parsers will get even faster due to improvements to `winnow`.
  Thanks, Ed Page, for single-handedly performing this transition.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-353d237fad17bc51f18218aa895b3ec1bbc97fb8/> `Identity` and `IdentityRef` with basic conversions, decoding and serialization.
   This is useful, for example, when writing `Co-authored-by: <actor>` messages or when
   parsing identities of actors by themselves.
   
   * `SignatureRef::actor()` is renamed to `identity()` as it now returns this type.
* `SignatureRef::empty()` was removed as it is only another name for `default()`.

## 0.20.0 (2023-04-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

### Chore

- <csr-id-634429a9c09dc9116bdb1c2317e7a96f27f2ddc8/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`
  This increases the compile time of the crate alone if there is no proc-macro
  in the dependency tree, but will ever so slightly improve compile times for `gix`
  as a whole.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.17.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/>
<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/> move loose header manipulation from git-pack to git-object

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.
 - <csr-id-5c8b0a44acfa708ef4ffe28cfde0dfed52b29d7c/> `Time::time` -> `Time::seconds_since_unix_epoch`
   And `Time::offset` to `Time::offset_in_seconds`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fd287530e06ada04b811d9c8526eb698bc4c90fe/> `From` implementation from `&Signature` to `SignatureRef<'_>`.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-027c43ce3b0206607b40882a0a1b69fa25b8d70f/> `SignatureRef::actor()` to more easily compare name and email.
   Comparing anything with actual timestamps will of cause fail eventually
   and make tests flaky.
 - <csr-id-a39bf71531ee0a6c8db082758d3212c805ce2bf0/> support for trimming of whitespace around name and email
   It's separated from parsing to assure we can round-trip, but it's
   made easy to obtain trimmed results using new methods.
   
   This high-level git-repository will also trim by default now.
 - <csr-id-70a259c11f12f55a5f26b02cac21ec000c76fb8b/> `Time::seconds()` shortcut
 - <csr-id-705adfd5a5cbec0498a3d67065f7296c0dab8337/> SignatureRef is now Copy
   It's a type with only copyable types inside, so should be copy itself.
   This makes it less awkward to use as well.
 - <csr-id-13799e200508dc67ea4fe6f3c97c47b50694cada/> Time::new(seconds_since_epoch, offset)
 - <csr-id-77ef2cb819f21ddc5d1ee9e94b5961e3ca5b3139/> `Time::default()`
 - <csr-id-f99851bb272ce2d81704712b9e70edaddc442589/> keep feature documentation inline with manifests

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.17.0 (2023-01-06)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.16.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.15.0 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.14.1 (2022-11-27)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fd287530e06ada04b811d9c8526eb698bc4c90fe/> `From` implementation from `&Signature` to `SignatureRef<'_>`.

## 0.14.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.13.0 (2022-10-10)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.12.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.11.4 (2022-08-24)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.11.3 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.11.2 (2022-08-19)

A maintenance release with a dependency update.

## 0.11.1 (2022-08-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-027c43ce3b0206607b40882a0a1b69fa25b8d70f/> `SignatureRef::actor()` to more easily compare name and email.
   Comparing anything with actual timestamps will of cause fail eventually
   and make tests flaky.

## 0.11.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.

## 0.10.1 (2022-06-13)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.10.0 (2022-05-18)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.9.0 (2022-04-03)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a39bf71531ee0a6c8db082758d3212c805ce2bf0/> support for trimming of whitespace around name and email
   It's separated from parsing to assure we can round-trip, but it's
   made easy to obtain trimmed results using new methods.
   
   This high-level git-repository will also trim by default now.
 - <csr-id-70a259c11f12f55a5f26b02cac21ec000c76fb8b/> `Time::seconds()` shortcut
 - <csr-id-705adfd5a5cbec0498a3d67065f7296c0dab8337/> SignatureRef is now Copy
   It's a type with only copyable types inside, so should be copy itself.
   This makes it less awkward to use as well.
 - <csr-id-13799e200508dc67ea4fe6f3c97c47b50694cada/> Time::new(seconds_since_epoch, offset)
 - <csr-id-77ef2cb819f21ddc5d1ee9e94b5961e3ca5b3139/> `Time::default()`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5c8b0a44acfa708ef4ffe28cfde0dfed52b29d7c/> `Time::time` -> `Time::seconds_since_unix_epoch`
   And `Time::offset` to `Time::offset_in_seconds`.

## 0.8.1 (2022-02-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f99851bb272ce2d81704712b9e70edaddc442589/> keep feature documentation inline with manifests

## 0.8.0 (2022-01-23)

A maintenance release thanks to upgraded dependencies.

<csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/>

Maintenance release due, which isn't really required but one now has to be careful what's committed at once.
